project name context
integration view
activity view
view looking on check



project name context:

	looks on project_view:project_br/LATEST or project_view:project_br/{latest check}
	project by name ->  ( global_db -> ) project-view


integration view: looks on int_br/LATEST
	project < stream

	view -> /nbu.meta/confetti/lots.ne








activity view: looks on act_br/LATEST
	activity < stream
	
	explain:
		view -?-> activity -> /nbu.meta/confetti/lots.ne
		or:
		view -> /nbu.meta/confetti/lots.ne
		
	PS: how do we know a view is an activity view? project integration view?
		- the user tells us by invoking an activity command
		- what about tt check?
		- maybe project.ne file should be named stream.ne?



view on check: looks on selection by label (nbu.meta/confetti/...)
	NO: project by context (looking at /nbu.meta/confetti/project.ne)

	view -> /nbu.meta/confetti/lots.ne
